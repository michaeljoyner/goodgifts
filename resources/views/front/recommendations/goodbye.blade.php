        <p>We hate to see you go, but heck, we understand. Some things just weren't made to last. This could be good for all of us, give us a chance to grow and move on. Once we stop crying that is. You heartless creature. Was one more email really so hard on you?</p>
        <p>Never contact me again.</p>
