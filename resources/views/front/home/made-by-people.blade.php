                <p class="lh-title">We’re not a bunch of robots. We’re real people who cry real tears, so we know that when it comes to gifts, it’s the thought that counts.</p>
                <p class="lh-title">We add our gifts by first choosing an interest, then brainstorming that interest good and proper, and finally writing an article on why each gift is a good one. We also throw in some added info where we can to make it easy for you. Go ahead and check out our gift guides right here, you’re sure to find some inspiration!</p>
